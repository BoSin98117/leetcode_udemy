/*
Sliding Window Approach

Solve using O(n) time using the 'SLIDING WINDOW' approach 
Sliding window will represent the current substring of non repeating characters we are on.
We will NOT be working with Sliding Windows of Fixed Size.
The window will grow or shrink in size as we iterate through the string.
Current index and value in for loop will ALWAYS BE END of the sliding window.
As end of window increases, we conditionally increase start of window.

Time Complexity = O(n) - Each character of the string needs to be visited once.
Space Complexity = O(min(m, n)) - The number of keys in Hash Map is bounded by the size of the string n and the size of the charset/alphabet m.
O(min(m, n)) means that whichever is smaller, m or n.
